# Alpha-Layer
Ethereum Alpha Layer

Alpha Layer is the first contract of a serie of OPEN CONTRACTS on the Ethereum Platform.
The meaning of Alpha Layer is to have an open central repository for all possible public informations regarding a wallet, a dapp, or a token.

If you control a wallet (or you are the "address public owner;" of a smart contract) you can control the relative informations on the Alpha Layer.

It is possible to add custom layers and extend Alpha Layer.

Beta Layer (graph theory?) and Omega Layer (opposite functions of Alpha Layer that is individual, Omega Layer is collective) are coming soon. Stay tuned.
